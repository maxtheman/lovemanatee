**Manatees aren't hard to find, but deserve respect in their natural habitats**

#Why should I visit the manatees?

You should visit the manatee because they are an extraordinary species unlike almost anything else you'll see on the North American continent. The Florida manatee is a long-living, intelligent creature which dwells in the coastal waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Even though they are commonly referred to as "sea cows", they are much smarter than a cow and their closest relation is the African Elephant.

They also play a role in our modern culture. Manatees are mammals which share many traits with us and are drawn to warm water like rivers and springs -- much in the same way as us humans. This similarity lends to a tendancy for us to anthropomorphize them more than we might other animals, like dolphins. Aside from occasionaly being mistaken for mermaids, we also like to repropduce them as superheros in drawings and internet memes. They've even been featured on the show South Park as (jokingly) the writers for FOX Studios.

#What am I allowed to do with the manatees?

Manatees, although no longer on the endangered species list, are very sensitive to human interference. We have more power over these gentle animals than we might otherwise believe! Similar to how you'd prefer not to be harassed by aliens visiting our world, please have some empathy for the manatees that you visit.

It is illegal to hug or restrain a manatee, although you are legally allowed to touch them with a single hand. [the Save the Manatee Club](http://www.savethemanatee.org/Tips.html) recommends not touching the creatures you see at all. It's unwise to feed the manatees you meet or give them water as they are naturally curious and this may incentize them to investigate other human elements -- like getting dangerously close to boat propellers.

What you are allowed and encouraged to do is take pictures and observe these animals from a distance which is safe for them. You can also use snorkels to get a better look at them underwater! If you are approached by a manatee there is no need to be alarmed, but encouraging its friendly behaivor will only present more trouble for them in the long run.
